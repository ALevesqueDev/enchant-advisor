# Enchant Advisor — project notes

**Decided:** Minecraft Java Edition only · web app · advisor + anvil
combine-order/cost calculator.

## What it does

1. User picks an **item** (pickaxe, axe, sword, bow, crossbow, trident,
   armor piece, shield, fishing rod, elytra) and its **material tier** where
   relevant (tier mostly matters for durability/enchant slots, not for which
   enchants apply — same enchant pool for wood through netherite).
2. User enters **enchantments already on the item** (name + level).
3. User picks a **goal** from that item's goal taxonomy (below).
4. The advisor recommends the enchantment delta to add, respecting:
   - mutual-exclusivity groups (e.g. Fortune vs Silk Touch, Sharpness vs
     Smite vs Bane of Arthropods, Riptide vs Loyalty/Channeling, Multishot
     vs Piercing, Infinity vs Mending)
   - per-enchant max level
   - treasure-only enchants flagged (Mending, Frost Walker, Curse of
     Binding, Curse of Vanishing, Soul Speed, Swift Sneak — not available
     from the enchant table, only loot/trading/fishing, or the "Curses" via
     table+bonus)
   - what's already maxed vs still worth adding
5. Once the target set is confirmed, the **anvil calculator** gives the
   cheapest combine order and total XP levels, applying:
   - prior-work penalty (doubles: 0→1→2→4→8→... per item, resets never)
   - combine cost = sum of book/item level costs + penalties
   - the 39-level "Too Expensive!" survival cap (creative has none)

## Goal taxonomy (approved, then corrected during implementation)

Approved as drafted, then fixed against `src/lib/goals.ts` (now the source
of truth — see the file header there for the full rationale):

- **Fixed:** boots' "Discrétion" was wrongly attached to Soul Speed (which
  is a movement-speed enchant, not stealth). Swift Sneak — the actual
  stealth enchant — lives on **leggings**, not boots. Boots' Soul Speed goal
  is now correctly labeled "Vitesse sur sable des âmes".
- **Split:** boots' "Mobilité" became two goals (Depth Strider vs Frost
  Walker) since they're mutually exclusive — bundling them made no sense.
- **Added:** Shovel, Hoe, Mace, and Spear (the last two didn't exist in the
  first draft's scope). Spear/Lunge were added to the game in 1.21.11
  (Sept 2026), after this assistant's training cutoff — see the
  `enchantments.ts` header for what's verified vs. best-guess there.
- **Axe woodcutting excludes Fortune** even though the game allows it —
  wood always drops 1:1, so it does nothing for that goal.

See `src/lib/goals.ts` for the live table.

## Anvil rules reference

- Prior-work penalty formula, combine costs, and the enchant conflict table
  are fixed game data — see the [Minecraft Wiki: Anvil mechanics](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Anvil#Costs_for_combining_items)
  and [Enchanting mechanics](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Enchanting_mechanics)
  pages as the source of truth when implementing — don't hand-derive from
  memory, verify against the wiki tables.

## Not yet decided

- Whether to persist anything (accounts, saved builds) or keep it fully
  stateless/client-side — currently fully stateless, no backend
- Name (this is a placeholder working title)
- The anvil calculator only models "each enchant via one fresh book" — it
  doesn't yet handle pre-combining two lower-level books to reach a higher
  level before touching the final item, which is where combine *order*
  actually starts to matter (see `src/lib/anvil.ts` header)
- Deployment (not yet live anywhere — runs locally via `npm run dev`)

## Status

**MVP built and working**: Next.js + TypeScript + Tailwind, fully
client-side. Item picker → current-enchants input → goal picker →
recommendation + anvil cost, covering all 16 item categories. Data verified
against the Minecraft Wiki on 2026-09-11 (see `src/lib/enchantments.ts` and
`src/lib/anvil.ts` headers for sources and caveats). `npm run build` and
`npm run lint` both pass clean.
